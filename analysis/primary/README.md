# Primary Analysis

Primary analysis is utilizing the primary files (fastqs) through alignment. This should include alignment output and all associated pipeline files. If using something like the [nf-core](https://nf-co.re/pipelines) pipelines, you can essentially put the entire output of that run here, particularly the pipeline info and files that are used downstream. 

For something like scRNA, this should include at minimum the input .h5 files and web summary files from cellranger.
