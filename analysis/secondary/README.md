# Secondary Analysis

Secondary analysis is utilizing the primary files (fastqs) through alignment. This should include alignment output and all associated pipeline files. If using something like the [nf-core](https://nf-co.re/pipelines) pipelines, you can essentially put the entire output of that run here. 

For something like scRNA, this should include at minimum the input .h5 files and web summary files from cellranger.
