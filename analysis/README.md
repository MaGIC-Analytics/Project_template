# Analysis directory

This directory should hold all analysis files. It can be split into tiers of analysis and then further split as needed. 
For example, in RNA-seq the secondary analysis files should include the aligned bam files and all initial pipeline files. 

Notebook files should be held in appropriate directory level as needed.
