# Tertiary analysis

Tertiary analysis is everything that goes on beyond secondary. If there are multiple stages, this can be further expanded to quartenary as well. I personally like to organize this by type of request and/or by date of delivery. So for follow up heatmaps, I would have a directory "Heatmaps" which is then subdivided by date of heatmap request as there are usually multiple rounds.
